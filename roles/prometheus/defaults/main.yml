# this is a least precedence directory. Actually ansible will throw error if any variable is not declared in ansible then it will definitely throws you an error. so we are declaring variable in defaults directory. However we can override by providing them in command line
prometheus_server: true 
node_exporter: false
exporter_url: https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
exporter_dir: "{{ exporter_url | split('/') | last | regex_replace('.tar.gz', '')}}"

# exporter_url is installation link but our service presented in /opt diretory and node_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64 is a directory presented in opt directory. This directory name is a part of url so we used filter command and split function to split url based on delimiter we specify. here it is url so obviously / is delimeter. but there is .tar.gz so we used search and replace ansible method called regex_replace so with this we are replacing .tar.gz with empty.
